This is my new Portage tree overlay.

You can add it with =eselect repository=:
#+begin_src sh
eselect repository add getburning git https://github.com/GetBurning/getburning-overlay
#+end_src
Or with a configuration file in =/etc/portage/repos.conf/=:
#+NAME: getburning.conf
#+begin_src conf
[getburning]
location = /var/db/repos/getburning
sync-type = git
sync-uri = https://github.com/GetBurning/getburning-overlay
#+end_src
Or just copy things to your own overlay.
